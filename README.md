# java-eight-samples

First of all, welcome and enjoy... 


This is a resume about the java eight functionalities based on the book **"Java 8 Prático - Lambdas, Streams e os Novos Recursos"** from Casa do código. 

 The two main objectives of this project are:
* To learn the new functionalities and the concepts of the Java 8.
* To improve my English level.  

**I wrote a detailed wiki, explaining all details about the subject, I recommend you see the source code but read the wiki too. Enjoy it and do not forget to tell me what do you think!**  

Please sorry if you note some mistake and please tell me, I will fix it and learn with this situation. ;)
