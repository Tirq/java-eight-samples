This is a resume about the java eight functionalities based on the book "Java 8 Prático - Lambdas, Streams e os novos recursos" from casa do código.

The two main objectives from this project are:
* To learn the new functionalities and the concepts inside the java 8.
* To improve my English level.

I wrote a detailed wiki, explaining all details about the subject, I recommend you see the source code but too read the wiki. 

Sorry if you note some mistake and please tell me, I will fix it and learn with this situation. ;)
